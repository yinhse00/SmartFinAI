      text: `Timetable for a Rights Issue under Hong Kong Listing Rules

This timetable outlines the typical steps and timeline for a rights issue under the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) Listing Rules (Main Board), assuming no general meeting is required for shareholder approval (e.g., pre-emption rights are maintained per Rule 13.36(2)(a) or a general mandate exists). The schedule is indicative and may vary based on company circumstances, whether the issue is renounceable, and specific regulatory approvals. Always consult legal and financial advisors for compliance. References align with the HKEx Listing Rules and market practice.

| Date/Event | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| T-30 to T-60 (1â€“2 months before announcement) | Prepare draft prospectus or listing document and related materials. Submit to HKEx for review if required (Rule 14.04). Engage underwriters, if any (Rule 10.24A). |
| T-1 (Day before announcement) | Board meeting to approve the rights issue. Underwriting agreement (if applicable) signed and held in escrow. Finalize listing document details. |
| T (Announcement Day) | Announce the rights issue via a Regulatory Information Service (RIS) (Rule 10.22). Publish listing document/prospectus (Rule 14.08). If underwritten, disclose underwriter details and compliance with Rule 10.24A. For non-fully underwritten issues, disclose risks on the front cover (Rule 10.23). |
| T+1 | Submit application for listing of nil-paid rights and new shares to HKEx (Rule 10.26). HKEx reviews and approves listing. |
| T+2 | Record date to determine eligible shareholders. Dispatch Provisional Allotment Letters (PALs) to shareholders (for renounceable issues) (Rule 10.31). |
| T+3 | Nil-paid rights trading begins on HKEx (for renounceable issues). Typically lasts 10 business days (market practice). |
| T+12 (10 business days after T+2) | Nil-paid rights trading ends. Deadline for shareholders to accept rights and pay for shares (Rule 10.29). Excess application period closes (if applicable, per Rule 10.31(3)). |
| T+13 to T+14 | Calculate acceptances and excess applications. Notify underwriters of any shortfall (if underwritten). Underwriters arrange for sale of unsubscribed shares ("rump placement") (Rule 10.31(1)(b)). |
| T+15 | Announce results of the rights issue via RIS, including subscription levels and rump placement details (if any) (Rule 10.32). |
| T+16 | New shares issued and admitted to trading on HKEx. Dealings in fully-paid shares commence. Refund cheques (if any) dispatched to shareholders for excess applications. |
| T+17 onwards | Finalize accounts with clearing systems (e.g., CCASS). Update share register. |`,
